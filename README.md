# React.js Boilerplate

This is a boilerplate/template project for building React.js applications, utilizing several modern technologies and libraries including Effector for state management, Farfetched for data fetching, Cypress for end-to-end testing, Bun as runtime, Vite for fast development environment, Storybook for component documentation and testing, react-testing-library and Jest for unit testing, and Emotion for styling.

## Technologies Used

- **Effector**: State management library for React applications.
- **Farfetched**: Lightweight and composable data fetching library.
- **Cypress**: End-to-end testing framework.
- **Bun**: Fast JS runtime.
- **Vite**: Fast, opinionated web dev build tool that serves your code via native ES Module imports during development.
- **Storybook**: UI component explorer for frontend developers.
- **React Testing Library** and **Jest**: For unit testing React components.
- **Emotion**: A performant and flexible CSS-in-JS library.

## Features

- Effortless state management with Effector.
- Simplified data fetching with Farfetched.
- Comprehensive testing capabilities with Cypress, Jest, and React Testing Library.
- Efficient styling using Emotion.
- Rapid development setup with Vite.
- Component documentation and testing facilitated by Storybook.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Bun installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jassix/react-boilerplate.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd react-boilerplate
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

### Development

To start the development server, run:

```bash
bun dev
```

This will start the Vite development server.

### Building

To build the project for production, run:

```bash
bun run build
```

This will generate a production-ready build in the `dist` directory.

### Testing

#### Unit Testing

To run unit tests using Jest, execute:

```bash
bun run test
```

#### End-to-End Testing

Cypress is used for end-to-end testing. To run Cypress tests, use:

```bash
bun run test:e2e
```

### Storybook

To start Storybook and view your components in isolation, run:

```bash
bun storybook
```
